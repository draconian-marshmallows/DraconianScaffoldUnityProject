# Scaffold: Project Cat Food #
This is the "dog fooding" project to find issues with Scaffold. 
This may contain multiple game projects to test different aspects of the framework. 


## Dreams of the Creature Conjurer ##
In a nutshell: this is a medieval themed game with aspects of Pokemon mixed with the Bard's Tale. 

- From the Bard's Tale we take exploring & navigating a 3D/2.5D world, possibly starting in a city. 
We also face enemies that we must fight or run from. I'd like the solo combat to be real-time: sword swinging, & spell casting. 

- At some point in the game you can acquire magical creatures to fight beside you.  Initially I see this as a configuration you'd make on each creature, which would then tell them how they'd auto-battle along side you. The creatures I imagine looking something like those in Dungeon Keeper. Another nice-to-have feature would be possessing your creatures(which is also a thing in Dungeon Keeper) to allow you to fight in real-time through their eyes. 

- Maybe the story could revolve around an enemy conjurer that's trying to obtain powerful creatures. 

### Key Differences from Inspirations
- In order to obtain most of the desirable creatures you must enter Dungeons to steal eggs, etc. 

- You must have enough space in your lair to house your creatures. You must free creatures to make space for new creatures if your lair is not big enough. 

- Maybe you are the want-to-be BIG BAD of this world. Maybe you have to study under other evil conjurers. 


## Invader's Strike Back ##
This is an old concept I built back in 2016/7 where you're in a flying saucer dropping bombs on a city. The whole mechanic is to destroy a target amount of the city.
